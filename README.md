# StreamApp	

### Overview

An app that will allow the users to discover new films, by providing the stream of different trailers. It will bring some great features that are being developed at the moment. 

The idea is to give the users a full package by allowing them to go through a variety of films, book tickets to go to the cinema, and balancing it with social media networks, by providing and recieving feedback about a particular film.

A good user experince is expected because each film will have it's own rating and will be organised into different categories, which will be effective for the user reach of content he/her is looking for.
