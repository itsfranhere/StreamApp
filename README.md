# StreamApp	

### Overview

An app that stream film trailers. It will bring some great features that are being developed at the moment. The idea is to allow the user to book tickets to go to the cinema, and to take advantage of the social media, such as getting feedback from it, and even share their own opinion. 

Each film will have its own rating and will be organised into different categories, which will provide a better user experience.
